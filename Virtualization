//Virtualization

Virtualization is creating a virtual base of something that can be of network, server, application anything.
There are hypervisors that basically pull the resources from the physical server and compute them to our virtual environment.

Two types of Hypervisors:

Type 1:
Installed directly on top of the physical server.
Most frequently used.
Most secure.
eg.VMware ESXi vSphere, KVM

Type 2:
A layer of host between the physical server and the hypervisor.
Less frequent.
Mostly used end-user virtualization.
Eg. Oracle, virtual box, VMware Workstation.


Once the hypervisor is installed we can set up virtual machines.
A VM is simply a software-based computer, it runs like a simple computer, they have os and application and they are completely independent of one another.
You can run multiple of VM on a hypervisor.

A hypervisor manages the resources that are allocated to these VM from the physical server.
As they are independent we can run different software on different virtual machines.
We can move one virtual machine from one hypervisor to another hypervisor on a different machine.

Benefits:
Cost savings
Lowers downtime
Sustainability
